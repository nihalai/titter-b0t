# titter-b0t

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Tweepy library to tweet ‘Allahu Akbar’ every 5 hours. The script authenticates with Twitter using your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. You can adjust the frequency of the tweets by modifying the ‘time.sleep’ line in the code.
